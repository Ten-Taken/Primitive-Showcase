# Primitive-Showcase

A cleaned-up small collection of some of my school projects, intended to showcase language exposure to potential employers or clients.

master branch
-------------

Project directories are organized by language and each contain a 'ReadMe' file 
with pertinent information. Where possible, the original instructions or project specifications will also be present. 

While the majority of content in this repository was authored soley by me,
some projects (namely in the Java directory) contain supplemental drivers
which were provided by a course instructor. Where this is the case,
those files have been noted.  Also for this reason, I provide no
explicit license for this repository.

gh-pages branch
-------------------

In the gh-pages branch you will find a sample of some front-end web projects.  To view the 
rendered projects, and repository home page, visit  https://ten-taken.github.io/Primitive-Showcase/
