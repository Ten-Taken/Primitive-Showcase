# Primitive-Showcase

A cleaned-up small collection of some of my school projects, intended to showcase language exposure to potential employers or clients.

Project directories are organized by language and each contain a 'ReadMe' file 
with pertinent information. Where possible, the original instructions or project specifications will also be present. 

While the majority of content in this repository was authored soley by me,
some projects (namely in the Java directory) contain supplimental drivers
which were provided by a course instructor. Where this is the case,
those files have been explicitly noted.  Also for this reason, I provide no
explicit license for this repository.
