This project focuses on working with properties in the BOM (browser object model).


Project Specifications
------------------------------


1. Use an HTML element event to call a function you wrote named
displaySize() that displays the width and height of the user’s screen.

2. Use an HTML element event to call a function you wrote named
displayLocation() that displays the URL location of the current page.

3. Use an HTML element event to call a function you wrote named
changeLocation() that uses the assign method to change the URL location
and load a new document.

4. Add a button “Back” to your page which loads the previous URL in the
history list.

5. Add a button “Forward” to your page which loads the next URL in the
history list.

6. Use an HTML element event to call a function you wrote named
browserInformation() that uses the navigator object to display the
following information:

	• appName

	• appCodeName

	• product (engine name)

7. Use a confirm box to ask the user if they would like to see the following
information from the navigator object:

	• appVersion

	• userAgent

	• platform

8. Include a prompt box to ask the user to enter their favorite browser. Include
the name of your personal favorite browser as the default value. Display
the results.

9. Include a clock on your page that displays the current local time and
advances each second.

10. Include a button on your page to stop/start the clock on your page. The
text on the button should display “Stop” when the clock is running and
should display “Start” when the timer is stopped. The start/stop
functionality should be perpetual – meaning that the button can be clicked
multiple times.

11. Display three images on the page five seconds after the page is opened.

12. Include three text boxes to enter values for the following cookies: name,
school, and hobby. Include a button that creates the three cookies (with
values). Include three more buttons. Each button deletes a cookie.
13. Include a function that will check the existence of each cookie when the
page is accessed. If one or more of the cookies is not set, an alert box
should notify the user to set the unset cookie(s). If all three cookies are set,
the alert box should display the contents of each cookie.
