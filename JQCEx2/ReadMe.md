This project is focused on basic JQuery core animation.


Project Specifications
-------------------------------

1. Use the jQuery hide() method to hide all three colored `` <div> `` when a hide
button is clicked. Use the jQuery show() method to show all three colored
`` <div> `` when a show button is clicked. Set the hide() and show() to occur
over 300 milliseconds.

2. Use the jQuery toggle() method to hide/show the three `` <div> `` from item 1.
Set the toggle() to occur over 700 milliseconds.

3. Include a table with at least 10 rows. Odd and even rows should be different
colors. Include a button to toggle hide/show the odd rows and a button to
toggle hide/show the even rows.

4. Include an element that uses jQuery to toggle-fade a `` <footer> `` element on
the page for 1000 milliseconds.

5. Include an element that uses jQuery to fade a `` <section> `` from black to 20%
of black to reveal the word “Hello”.

6. Center two `` <div> `` elements on the page and use jQuery to toggle-slide the
appearance of the lower by clicking the upper.

7. Include two 100x100px `` <div> `` elements. Float one to the left (left-div) and
the other to the right (right-div). Include a button “#7 Move Left-Div” which
moves the left-div to the right 200px. Include a button “#7 Move Right-Div”
which moves the right-div to the left 200px.

8. Include the text “jQuery Growing” in a `` <div> `` element. Include a `` <button> ``
that causes the text to animate slowly up to 5em.

9. This is similar to item 7 but uses a callback and only one button. Include two
100x100px `` <div> `` elements. Float one to the left (left-div) and the other to
the right (right-div). Include a button “#9 Demonstrate Callback” which
moves the left-div to the right 200px and then invokes a callback to move
the right-div to the left 200px.

10. Start with a 100x100px `` <div> ``. Include a button which invokes animation to
increase the height to 400px. Using chaining, hide the `` <div> `` over 3000
milliseconds.
