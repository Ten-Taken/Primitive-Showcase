            					<h3>Welcome</h3>
            					This is the served site for my Primitive-Showcase repository, gh-pages branch. 
            					Here you will find a small sampling of  front-end web projects I built for a few courses.
            					<br><br>
						To view the project specifications for each sample, mouse over the corresponding tab here.
						Projects will open in a separate tab or window. To view the project specifications and source on GitHub, navigate to the gh-pages branch (linked above).
            					<br><br>
            					I'm using this branch to host entirely different content rather than
            					expand upon the same projects in origin master, which is instead focused on 
            					small console applications.
						<br><br>
						At this time, GitHub only serves static pages, so I have not included any of
						my more advanced projects. However, I have included one example PHP project in the branch
						that is not rendered here, to show some experience with server-side code.
						<br><br>
						This repository is not intended to display any proficiency in polished web-design, (nor does
						it use a Jekyll theme) only language exposure and functionality.

            					<h3>Project Specifications</h3>
            					<ol>
            					<li>Include the following elements: header, section, article, nav,
						footer. Include a p element in the header and footer. Include
						div elements in the section, article, and nav. Use lightgrey borders
						and text to identify the elements. All of the requirements below use this
						page structure.</li>
						<br>
						<li> Create a button with a click event that uses jQuery and CSS to identify with
						a blue border the direct parents of the p and div elements. When
						clicked, the button should toggle the borders from default (lightgrey) to
						blue to default etc. </li>
						<br>
						<li> Assign an id to a div in the nav element. Create a button with a click
						event that uses jQuery and CSS to identify with a red border ALL ancestor
						elements of the div with the id. When clicked, the button should toggle
						the borders from default (lightgrey) to red to default etc.</li>
						<br>
						<li> Create a button with a click event that uses jQuery and CSS to identify the
						children of the nav and article tags with a black border. When clicked,
						the button should toggle the borders from default (lightgrey) to black to
						default etc. </li>
						<br>
						<li> Create a button with a click event that uses jQuery and CSS to identify with
						a #90F border the descendants of the section that are div elements.
						When clicked, the button should toggle the borders from default (lightgrey)
						to #90F to default etc. </li>
						<br>
						<li> Create a button with a click event that uses jQuery and CSS to identify with
						a #3C3 border the siblings of the p that is a child of the header
						element. When clicked, the button should toggle the borders from default
						(lightgrey) to #3C3 to default etc. </li>

            					<ol>
            					<li> Use the jQuery hide() method to hide all three colored div when a hide
						button is clicked. Use the jQuery show() method to show all three colored
						div when a show button is clicked. Set the hide() and show() to occur
						over 300 milliseconds. </li>
						<br>
						<li> Use the jQuery toggle() method to hide/show the three div from item 1.
						Set the toggle() to occur over 700 milliseconds. </li>
						<br>
						<li> Include a table with at least 10 rows. Odd and even rows should be different
						colors. Include a button to toggle hide/show the odd rows and a button to
						toggle hide/show the even rows. </li>

						<li> Include an element that uses jQuery to toggle-fade a footer element on
						the page for 1000 milliseconds. </li>
						<br>
						<li> Include an element that uses jQuery to fade a section from black to 20%
						of black to reveal the word “Hello”. </li>
						<br>
						<li> Center two div> elements on the page and use jQuery to toggle-slide the
						appearance of the lower by clicking the upper. </li>
						<br>
						<li> Include two 100x100px div elements. Float one to the left (left-div) and
						the other to the right (right-div). Include a button “#7 Move Left-Div” which
						moves the left-div to the right 200px. Include a button “#7 Move Right-Div”
						which moves the right-div to the left 200px. </li>
						<br>
						<li> Include the text “jQuery Growing” in a div element. Include a button
						that causes the text to animate slowly up to 5em. </li>
						<br>
						<li> This is similar to item 7 but uses a callback and only one button. Include two
						100x100px div elements. Float one to the left (left-div) and the other to
						the right (right-div). Include a button “#9 Demonstrate Callback” which
						moves the left-div to the right 200px and then invokes a callback to move
						the right-div to the left 200px. </li>
						<br>
						<li> Start with a 100x100px div. Include a button which invokes animation to
						increase the height to 400px. Using chaining, hide the div over 3000
						milliseconds. </li>
