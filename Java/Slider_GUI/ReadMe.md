About
-------------

This program renders a graphical slider widget which adjusts a numeric value
as it moves.  The original purpose of the program was to display some understanding
of working with both AWT and Swing API's for creating GUI components.

:boom: :boom: **Important** :boom: :boom:
	To be 100% clear, I only authored the SlideRunner source file. I did not author the SlideDriver source file. This file was supplied by the course instructor to be used
	as a driver class to build around.(Though its only functionality is instantiating an object of the SlideRunner class). Identifying information has been removed to 
	prevent future students from using the project.


Testing
-------------

While you can recompile the bytecode if you wish, there are class files present.

To run, simply open a terminal and enter: *java SlideDriver*


Program Specifications
----------------------

Write a program that uses the driver class definition provided to produce the graphic output image shown (not shown here).

At startup, the thumb on the slider is positioned at 50 and the number 50 is displayed above the thumb. As you move the slider to the left or right, the number that is displayed tracks the position of the thumb on the slider scale.

The program must terminate and return control to the operating system when you click the large X in the upper-right corner of the GUI containing the slider.
