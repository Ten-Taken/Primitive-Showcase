in the JQuery UI library, including Drag, Drop, Resize, Select, and Sort.


Project Specifications
------------------------------

1. Create two '<div>' elements, one inside the other. Ensure the inner '<div>' can
be dragged but only within the outer '<div>'.

2. Create two '<div>' elements, one inside the other. Ensure the inner '<div>' can

4. Create two '<div>' elements on the left (L1, L2) and two '<div>' elements on
the right (R1, R2). Set the options such that only L1 can be dropped in R1
and only L2 can be dropped in R2. Also, L1 should be considered dropped
when it touches R1 and L2 must be contained within R2 before it is
considered dropped. R1 and R2 should change colors when L1 and L2 hover
over their targets.

5. Create a resizable '<article>' element with the ghost option enabled.

6. Demonstrate the use of the containment, minheight, and minWidth options
on a '<nav>' element within a '<section>' element.

7. Create four small '<div>' elements that are side-by-side. Make all four
resizable. If any one of the '<div>' elements is resized, the other three are
resized also.

8. Create an ordered list of seven items. Use the selectable method along with
the filter option to ensure only the first and last elements of the list are
